# React-Redux-Weather
This is a weather data aggregation app created with React and Redux. It was built using the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript coding languages, as well as the axios, react-redux, react-dom, redux-promise node packages. I also used the OpenWeatherMap API to gather the weather data for the city entered by the user and the Google Maps JavaScript API to display a map of the city. The Sparklines node package was used to create a chart display for the different types of weather information the user gets back including temperate, atmospheric pressure, and humidity.
